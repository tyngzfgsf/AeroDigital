## 📱 About The App

**Scout** is a premium utility designed to bring clarity to your interview preparation. Unlike other coaching apps that rely on cloud processing, Scout is engineered with a privacy-first architecture.

Everything—from your chat history to your answer drafts—is processed and stored locally on your device.

### ✨ Key Features

* **🤖 Intelligent Chat:** Simulate interview scenarios with an AI logic designed for behavioral questions.
* **🔒 Secure by Default:** No internet required for data processing. Your resume data never leaves your phone.
* **📜 History Tracking:** Review past sessions to see how your answers have improved over time.
* **⚡ Native Performance:** Built with native Android code for a buttery smooth, experience.
